# STOP THE COUNT
Make Danold win the election by preventing the opponent voters to get to the ballot boxes.

## Story
Once upon a time, there was a blond haired, orange skinned, ~~duck~~*man*. His name was **Danold Tump** This story took place in a far away country called the Disunited States of America. The orange man was meant to take the place as supreme leader, and restore peace and harmony between the states.

It was without **counting** on the many opponents of the well-combed man. Many tried for several years to keep him from accessing the power. They tried to poison him with a red apple, to put him to sleep forever by making him sting himself with a spindle of a spinning wheel. But to their despair, the strong man got out with it each time.

This was all until recently, when **Jeo Bedin** was brought out of his cave by a team of **Tump**'s fierce opponents. Now **Tump** is losing the election, and must show his real powers to change the balance, and **stop the count**.
